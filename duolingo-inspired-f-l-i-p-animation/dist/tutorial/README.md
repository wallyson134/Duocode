# SVG Tutorial

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/wallyson134/pen/NWVpyRV](https://codepen.io/wallyson134/pen/NWVpyRV).

In this SVG tutorial we go through the source code of 24 SVGs from simple to more complex ones. We cover basic shapes, quadratic and cubic Bézier curves, arcs, how to use groups to transform part of an image, and some fun examples on how to animate SVG with CSS and how to make them interactive with JavaScript.
